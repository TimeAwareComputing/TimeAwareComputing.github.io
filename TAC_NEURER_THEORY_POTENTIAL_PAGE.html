<h1><a class="anchor" id="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_ASSUCH"></a>
The potential as a basic quantity</h1>
<p>The primary quantity when speaking about electric effects, is the <b><em>charge</em></b>. The frequently cited saying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherchez_la_femme"><em>Cherchez la femme</em></a>, used in the sense that no matter what the problem, a woman is often the root cause. Our motto is similar: <em>Look for the charge</em>, meaning "no matter what the problem, some charge is often the root cause".</p>
<p><a href="https://slideplayer.com/slide/272952/1/images/29/Equipotential+Surfaces+%26+Their+Relation+to+Electric+Field.jpg">The <em>charge</em> produces electric field</a>, see <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#Fig_EquipotentialSurfaces">Fig_EquipotentialSurfaces</a>. The electrically charged carriers can be accumulated on a surface, and they form a <em>potential surface</em>, see also Figure <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#Fig_MembraneAsCondensator">Fig_MembraneAsCondensator</a>.</p>
<div class="fallacy"> <b>Fallacy:</b><br  />
 In neurobiology, <b><em>the shorthand notation</em></b> such as that action potential is generated, travels, arrives, or action potentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next, etc.<b><em> always means that the potential is accompanied with transmitting charge</em></b>, although in many different envelopes, see also section <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_SIGNAL">Neuronal signalling</a>. </div><p><a class="anchor" id="Fig_EquipotentialSurfaces"></a></p><div class="image">

Electric charge and electric field</div></div>
 <p>In neurophysiology, it is a common situation to have different compartments with different solved components in the compartments, separated by a selectively permeable membrane, such as in Figure <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#Fig_TwoCompartmentsMembrane">Fig_TwoCompartmentsMembrane</a>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Fig_TwoCompartmentsMembrane"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="two_compartments_separated_by_membrane_w.jpg" alt="" width="500px"/>
<div class="caption">
Two solution compartments separated by a selectively permeable membrane</div></div>
 <p>Those solved components have dual properties: on one side they have, as chemical particles, a concentration (and may experience a gradient) and on the other side an electrical charge (and may experience electrical force). That is, their behavior is under dual control: both the concentration gradient and the electric force will affect their motion (and their location in their stationary states), and in addition the membrane selectively permeable for the different solved components. This dual control accompanied with selective permeability on one side needs careful analysis and on the other side enables the "wonder of life". See also <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/soldif.html">Energetics of Solute Diffusion</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/biovolt.html">nice summary </a> helps a lot in understanding role of voltages in biology. The case is not simple at all<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/actran.html">, both the active and passive mechanisms</a> as well as <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/allosteric.html">and the allosteric effects influence what happens.</a> If multiple ions and permeabilities are present, the <a href="https://www.physiologyweb.com/calculators/ghk_equation_calculator.html">Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation</a> can be used to calculate the resting potential. . Given that the relative membrane permeability of different ions are included, the potential surely changes if any of the channels closes/opens; that is, opening a channel alone, may start a rearrangement process, which can be described by a set of rather complex differential equations. In general, it is wort to visit site <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/allosteric.html">for physical explanation of less understood biological statements.</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_MEMBRANE"></a>
The membrane potential</h1>
<p>The result of the mentioned two forces: charged components appear on the opposite surfaces of the (insulator) membrane : it will act as a condensator. <a class="anchor" id="Fig_MembraneAsCondensator"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="electric-charge-and-electric-field.jpg" alt="" width="728px"/>
<div class="caption">
Membrane as a condensator</div></div>
 <p>The <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/celmem.html">membrane</a> potential is actually a <em>difference of potentials</em> measured between intracellular and extracellular sections of the organism. Several <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/mempot.html">mechanisms </a> maintain a small voltage or "potential" across the membrane in its normal or resting state, including <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/nakpump.html">pumps</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases this nameing convention makes a difference (both intra and extracellular potential can be changed artificially and independently, and leads to change in the <em>difference</em> what if called membrane potential), so it would be more appropriate to call it as <em>membrane voltage</em>. Given that the simulator considers the neurons only at signalling level, the specific processes affecting potential values are not discussed, we only refer to the cited works, discussing the physiology (and/or technology) behind.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_ACTION"></a>
The action potential</h1>
<p>One of the most important feature of the membrane's potential that it changes in a very specific way. Figure <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#Fig_NeuronalActionPotential">Fig_NeuronalActionPotential</a> shows how an action potential runs in time, with separated phases. As our goal is to discuss <em>only</em> the details the operation of our simulator relies on (this booklet does not want to be a textbook), all physically and biologically relevant details are left to discuss in the appropriate cited references. However, some fallacies are discussed, given that they are not consistently described in the different sources and may lead to confusion. First of all, always keep in mind that the <em>charge</em> produces electric field (and potential), including the action potential.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Fig_NeuronalActionPotential"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="neuronal_action_potential_phases_w.jpg" alt="" width="600px"/>
<div class="caption">
Different phases of the neuronal action potential</div></div>
 <p>Initially, the membrane of the neuron is at its resting potential. A stimulus (delivering change to its input section) from a sensory cell or another neuron(s) (or experimenter's signal) causes the neuron to depolarize toward the threshold potential ("Triggering" phase); the neuron starts its "computing". In this phase the "operands" are delivered to the input section of the neuron (the computing unit). Triggering can be a slow process, even it can fail (drops back to resting potential, as leaking leads to losing charge). If this excitation is successful (depending on the contribution of the stimulus and the "leaking" of the neuron), the membrane's potential reaches the threshold potential value (which corresponds to a threshold of the stored change), the neuron enters its "Charging" phase. Until it enters that phase, it is "computing". In the Charging phase, another mechanism comes into play: the membrane charges ("depolarizes") to its peak potential value (the yellow zone): it accumulates ions on its membrane. <em>Important that the source of charge is different: no more charge arrives from its input section</em>. Computing is finished, the result is on its way to the output section, but not yet available. When that voltage (that is : that charge) arrived, the result will be available for the external world. Again another mechanism starts to work: the membrane enters its "Dischanging" phase and discharges ("repolarizes"): sends out the accumulated charge through its axon. Due to some reason ("dumping" in the RC circuit model or opening other ion channel(s) in the chemical description) it can enter its phase "Overrun": the membrane potential drops below the resting potential ("hyperpolarization") and finally, it reaches again its initial phase: returns to its resting potential, and ready to process its cycle again.</p>
<p>The figure also shows some typical values on its axes. Notice that the zero point of the time scale is at a point when the membrane potential becomes noticeably higher than the resting potential.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_SIGNAL"></a>
Neuronal signalling</h1>
<p>For an axion potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon (i.e. charge must be delivered) to the axon terminal where it can initiate neurotransmitter release <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HowNeuronsCommunicate">[4]</a>. In the case of chemical synapses, see <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#Fig_ChemicalSynapticTransfer">Fig_ChemicalSynapticTransfer</a> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HowNeuronsCommunicate">[4]</a>, <a href="https://openstax.org/books/biology/pages/35-2-how-neurons-communicate">the ions are transferred by the neurotransmitters to the entry of the ion channel</a>, (in this way they pass the synaptic cleft; see "ion movement" in the left inset). See also <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/neurtran.html">neurotransmitters</a>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Fig_ChemicalSynapticTransfer"></a></p><div class="image">

<div class="caption">
Neuronal communication using ion channels (chemical synapse)</div></div>
 <p>In the case of electric synapses (saltatory conduction), see <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#Fig_ElectricSynapticTransfer">Fig_ElectricSynapticTransfer</a> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HowNeuronsCommunicate">[4]</a>, the ion channels need to (re)generate the axon potentials (i.e. generate ionic charge) only at the two endpoints of the axon (continuous depolarization and repolarisation of the Ranvier-nodes). This method enables faster condutions speed and consumes less energy. <a class="anchor" id="Fig_ElectricSynapticTransfer"></a></p><div class="image">
<img src="ElectricSynapticTransfer.jpg" alt="" width="600px"/>
<div class="caption">
Neuronal communication using saltatoric (electrical synapse)</div></div>
 <p>The two mechanisms cooperate as needed: in the postsynaptic neuron the charge does not deliver information about the type of the synapse.</p>
<ul>
<li>notice that <b><em>charge is delivered from one neuron to another</em></b>, although in many different envelopes</li>
<li><b><em>the amount of charge contribution entering the postsynaptic neuron depends on both the amount of the charge delivered to the terminal (depends on the presynaptic neuron) and how long the ion channels are open (depends on the postsynaptic neuron)</em></b></li>
<li><b><em>neurotransmitter may diffuse away </em></b> toward another (nearby) synaptic gap</li>
</ul>
<div class="fallacy"> <b>Fallacies:</b><br  />
 As also seen in Figure <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#Fig_ChemicalSynapticTransfer">Fig_ChemicalSynapticTransfer</a> <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HowNeuronsCommunicate">[4]</a>, the first step of synaptic communication is that (1) "Action potential arrives at axon terminal". This time, the ions are in the synaptic vehicles, this is why the potential arrives. As they keep arriving, they cannot leave the axon terminal, and the local potential increases. The increasing potential opens voltage-gated <em>Ca</em> channels, so <em>Ca</em> ions can now enter the axon terminal. Their entry causes synaptic vesicles to release their contents, the neurotransmitters (carrying ions). The neurotransmitters (with ions inside!) diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to ligand-gated ion channels on the postsynaptic membrane. After binding the ion passes on the opened ion channel, resulting in graded potential on both sides of the membrane. In the closing step the neurotransmitter is "recycled" (reuptake by the axon terminal, diffuse away from the synapse (NB: may diffuze away to another synaptic cleft, <em>enabling learning!</em>), or degrade enzymatically. </div><p><br  />
 The neuron works in a cyclic way: it must "recycle" the used resources and shall forget its "previous life" cycle. Correspondingly, two refractory times are interpreted, see Figure <a class="el" href="TAC_NEURER_THEORY_POTENTIAL_PAGE.html#Fig_NeuronalActionPotential">Fig_NeuronalActionPotential</a>. During the <em>absolute refratory</em> time, the synaptic input gates are closed (no more excitation is possible). After that period, the neuron is ready to operate again. However, its membrane potential is not yet reset. During this period, the <em>relative refratory</em> time the membrane is still relaxing, but the input charge from its synapses already contribute to its membrane's potential, so the <em>potential measurement will show the superposition of the past and present excitations</em>.</p>
<p><br  />
 </p><div class="fallacy"> <b>Fallacy:</b><br  />
 Some sources mis-identify the absolute refractory period and put the beginning of the time scale to the point where membrane potential starts to noticeably deviate from the resting potential. The absolute refractory time is anatomically defined, while the excitation time depends on many factors, including timing relations of fellow (pre-synaptic) neurons and its own learning mechanisms. Adding this extra 'foreign' time slightly falsifies the value of the absolute refractory time, and throught that, also falsifies the value of the maximum firing rate. When making statistics in a living mechanism, this mis-identification naturally adds a "tail" contribution to the distribution of firing times, and its effect can lead to assuming tailed (log-normal) distribution where the correct interpretation would result in non-tailed (normal) distribution. </div> </div></div><!-- contents -->
